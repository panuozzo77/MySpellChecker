## Goal
This project serves as a playground for exploring various methods and techniques to verify the syntactic correctness of text. Whether you're a language enthusiast, a beginner in programming, or a seasoned developer looking to dive into natural language processing (NLP), this repository offers a hands-on learning experience.

## Technologies
- Google API
- Your Brain

**FOR NOW**(maybe the project will change tools) you need to add a file "credentials.conf" in the root folder of the project like this:
``` bash
[Credentials]
api_key=your_Api_Key
cx=your_code here
```
- Run it.

### How to get these credentials:
